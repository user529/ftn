_help["overview"]="\
ftn is a wrapper for the tonos-cli.
Don't take it too seriously. It's just a local stuff that helps me to shrink long and boring commands into short ones.
In 'tonos' mode you can use with the following commands:
    config - the same as \"tonos-cli config\"
    getgonfig - the same as \"tonos-cli getconfig\"
    runget - runs method on the elector contract address
    exec - runs the passed command using the tonos-cli
    balance - show account balance
    accounts - list of account synomyms
    transactions - shows awaiting transactions on the account
    confirm - allows to confirm awaiting transactions with a key
    convert - converts an amount to nanotockens
    submit - submits tokens to an account
    checkrounds - checks if the stake has been sent 
    mode - displays the current mode
    help - displays this page
In 'validator' mode you can additionally use with the following commands:
    adnl - show current node adnl and pubkey
    timediff - shows how far your node is lagging behind the network
    electionrun - send the stake to the elections
    recover - recovers the unlocked tockens. It only works if elections are open.
    electionlog - shows the last N lines from the log of the \"electionrun\" command
    setstake - sets the stake amount used by the \"electionrun\" command

Check \"ftn help [sub-command]\" for additional help.

In most cases, the logs of these sub-commands can be found in the FTN_LOG directory. 
By default, FTN_LOG=/var/log/ftn.
