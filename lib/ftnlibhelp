_help["overview"]="\
ftn is a wrapper for the tonos-cli.
Don't take it too seriously. It's just a local stuff that helps me to shrink long and boring commands into short ones.
You can use with the following commands:
    config - the same as \"tonos-cli config\"
    getgonfig - the same as \"tonos-cli getconfig\"
    runget - runs method on the elector contract address
    exec - runs the passed command using the tonos-cli
    adnl - show current node adnl and pubkey
    balance - show account balance
    transactions - shows awaiting transactions on the account
    convert - converts an amount to nanotockens
    submit - submits tokens to an account
    electionrun - send the stake to the elections
    recover - recovers the unlocked tockens. It only works if elections are open.
    electionlog - shows the last N lines from the log of the \"electionrun\" command
    setstake - sets the stake amount used by the \"electionrun\" command
    timediff - shows how far your node is lagging behind the network
    help - displays this page

Check \"ftn help [sub-command]\" for additional help.

In most cases, the logs of these sub-commands can be found in the FTN_LOG directory. 
By default, FTN_LOG=/var/log/ftn.

    1.  if stake > balance then 
            stake=balance-1 #you can't send more than you have)
    2.  if stake < min_stake then 
            stake=0 #the amount on the balance is not enough and there is no point in sending any stake
